Description: A collection of 'LaTeX' styles using 'Beamer' customization for
 pdf-based presentation slides in 'RMarkdown'. At present it contains
 'RMarkdown' adaptations of the LaTeX themes 'Metropolis' (formerly 'mtheme')
 theme by Matthias Vogelgesang and others (now included in 'TeXLive'), the
 'IQSS' them by Ista Zahn (which is included here), and the 'Monash' theme by
 Rob J Hyndman. Additional (free) fonts may be needed: 'Metropolis' prefers
 'Fira', and 'IQSS' requires 'Libertinus'.
