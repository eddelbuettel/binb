Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2018-09-19
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel and Ista Zahn
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: A collection of 'LaTeX' styles using 'Beamer' customization for
 pdf-based presentation slides in 'RMarkdown'. At present it contains
 'RMarkdown' adaptations of the LaTeX themes 'Metropolis' (formerly 'mtheme')
 theme by Matthias Vogelgesang and others (now included in 'TeXLive'), and
 the 'IQSS' by Ista Zahn (which is included here). Additional (free) fonts
 may be needed: 'Metropolis' prefers 'Fira', and 'IQSS' requires 'Libertinus'.
